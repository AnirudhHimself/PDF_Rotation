Rotates PDFs

## The Issue
Sometimes I recieve pdf documents that aren't oriented the correct way. Sometimes these documents even have hundreds of pages.   

## Possible Solutions 
1. Use a questionable online tool that rotates them for you.
2. Manually click rotate on every page wasting precious minutes that could spend playing with a dog.
3. Crane the head in a painful, neck-snapping position to read a document.
4. Rotate the computer in a direction it was not meant to go such that it is impossible to refer to anything else with it.
5. Make a short program that rotates the pdf for me.

## The Choice
I chose option 5.
