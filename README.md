# PDF_Rotation
Rotates PDFs

## The Issue
Sometimes, I recieve pdfs that aren't oriented the correct way. This can happen if the pdfs are scanned pages. Sometimes these documents even have hundreds of pages.   

## Possible Solutions 
1. Use a questionable online tool that rotates them for you.
2. Manually click rotate on every page wasting precious minutes that could spend playing with a dog.
3. Crane my head in a painful, neck-snapping position to read a document.
4. Rotate the computer in an unorthodox way such that it is impossible to use it for anything else.
5. Make a short script that rotates the pdf for me.

## The Choice
I chose option 5.
